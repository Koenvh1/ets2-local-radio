This folder contains the ETS2 SDK plugin by RenCloud (https://github.com/RenCloud/scs-sdk-plugin)
Once you run ETS2 Local Radio for the first time, 
it should automatically ask you for the ETS2 folder and copy the files.
If it does not work, please copy the plugins manually to the ETS2 installation folder.
